Player class for the Market Royale game.

This module creates a player for the Market Royale game.

At the start of each turn, the player will:
 |Take stock of current inventory.
 |Take stock of current gold.
 |Tally gold on most recent previous market event.
 |Tally gold on most recent previous market colour change (if present).
 |Tally gold on most recent previous overdraft event.
 |Check glossary of researched information.
 |Check glossary of rumoured information. Rumours are information from other players.

Given the information, the player can do one of the following at the end of each turn:
 |Research current market.
 |Buy (product, amount) from current market.
 |Sell (product, amount) to current market.
 |Move to adjacent (market) from current market.
 |Pass turn and do nothing.
